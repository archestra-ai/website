## What is the MCP Catalog?

The MCP Catalog is an open-source, community-driven directory that helps developers discover, evaluate, and choose the best MCP servers for their AI applications. With the explosion of MCP servers in the ecosystem, we recognized the need for a curated platform that highlights quality, reliability, and innovation.

### Why We Built This

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Not all MCP servers are created equal. We evaluate each server based on code quality, documentation, community support, and protocol implementation.
- **Save Time**: Stop scrolling through endless GitHub repos. Find the right MCP server for your needs quickly.
- **Community-Driven**: Built by the community, for the community. Anyone can contribute!
- **Transparency**: Our scoring algorithm is open-source.
