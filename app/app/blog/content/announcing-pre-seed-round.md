Some time ago, I reached out to Ildar and Joey, two of the best engineers I know who at the time worked in the Grafana Labs, to validate an observation. We all saw that while every enterprise is experimenting with autonomous AI, they are all struggling to **securely connect models to their internal data**.

Well-connected autonomous agents amaze us, but also they could:
1) Leak sensitive data
2) Corrupt/delete sensitive data

This idea to address the problem excited us so much so we founded Archestra. ðŸŽ‰ It was quite a journey including relocation from Singapre and Israel to the UK and talking to **130+ investors**.

Today, I'm happy to announce a pre-seed funding round led by Concept Ventures joined by Zero Prime Ventures, Celero Ventures, RTP Global and Aloniq. Angels include: Max Hauser (Managing Director & Partner BCG), Maxim Konovalov (Nginx co-founder), Konstantin Vinogradov (GP at Runa Capital), Stephen Whitworth (CEO of incident.io), and Luke Harries (Elevenlabs).

# First-class citizen in the MCP world

It's hard to tell how many times we've been asked if MCP will be *"the protocol"* to connect AI and data and we believe it will. We see thousands of MCP servers on the GitHub connecting everything from Figma to Grafana to the AI and the community is only growing.


# Security first

MCP community got too excited to demonstrate the value so security became a 

## Supply chain security

## Runtime security

## Context security

# Open Source

It should be on-premises first and inference-vendor agnostic.
