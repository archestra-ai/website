MCP enables AI assistants and agents to query comprehensive biomedical datasets through structured interfaces. \n\nThe server automatically downloads the latest OpenGenes database and documentation from [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/longevity-genie/bio-mcp-data) (specifically from the `opengenes` folder), ensuring you always have access to the most up-to-date data without manual file management.\n\nThe OpenGenes database contains:\n\n- **lifespan_change**: Experimental data about genetic interventions and their effects on lifespan across model organisms\n- **gene_criteria**: Criteria classifications for aging-related genes (12 different categories)  \n- **gene_hallmarks**: Hallmarks of aging associated with specific genes\n- **longevity_associations**: Genetic variants associated with longevity from population studies\n\nIf you want to understand more about what the Model Context Protocol is and how to use it more efficiently, you can take the [DeepLearning AI Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/) or search for MCP videos on YouTube.\n\n## 🏆 Part of Holy Bio MCP Framework\n\nThis MCP server is part of the **[Holy Bio MCP](https://github.com/longevity-genie/holy-bio-mcp)** project - a unified framework for bioinformatics research that **won the Bio x AI Hackathon 2025** and continues to be actively developed and extended after the victory. \n\nThe Holy Bio MCP framework brings together multiple specialized MCP servers into a cohesive ecosystem for advanced biological research:\n\n- **[gget-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/gget-mcp)** - Genomics & sequence analysis toolkit\n- **[opengenes-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/opengenes-mcp)** - Aging & longevity genetics (this server)\n- **[synergy-age-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/synergy-age-mcp)** - Synergistic genetic interactions in longevity\n- **[biothings-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/biothings-mcp)** - Foundational biological data from BioThings.io\n- **[pharmacology-mcp](https://github.com/antonkulaga/pharmacology-mcp)** - Drug, target & ligand data\n\nTogether, these servers provide 50+ specialized bioinformatics functions that can work seamlessly together in AI-driven research workflows. Learn more about the complete framework at [github.com/longevity-genie/holy-bio-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/holy-bio-mcp).\n\n## Usage Example\n\nHere's how the OpenGenes MCP server works in practice with AI assistants:\n\n![OpenGenes MCP Usage Example](images/open-genes-usage-chat.png)\n\n*Example showing how to query the OpenGenes database through an AI assistant using natural language, which gets translated to SQL queries via the MCP server. You can use this database both in chat interfaces for research questions and in AI-based development tools (like Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code with Copilot) to significantly improve your bioinformatics productivity by having direct access to aging and longevity research data while coding.*\n\n## About MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n\nMCP is a protocol that bridges the gap between AI systems and specialized domain knowledge. It enables:\n\n- **Structured Access**: Direct connection to authoritative aging and longevity research data\n- **Natural Language Queries**: Simplified interaction with specialized databases through SQL\n- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and validation through FastMCP\n- **AI Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants and agents\n\n## Data Source and Updates\n\nThe OpenGenes MCP server automatically downloads data from the [longevity-genie/bio-mcp-data](https://huggingface.co/longevity-genie/bio-mcp-data) repository on Hugging Face Hub. This ensures:\n\n- **Always Up-to-Date**: Automatic access to the latest OpenGenes database without manual updates\n- **Reliable Distribution**: Centralized data hosting with version control and change tracking\n- **Efficient Caching**: Downloaded files are cached locally to minimize network requests\n- **Fallback Support**: Local fallback files are supported for development and offline use\n\nThe data files are stored in the `opengenes` subfolder of the Hugging Face repository and include:\n- `open_genes.sqlite` - The complete OpenGenes database\n- `prompt.txt` - Database schema documentation and usage guidelines\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThis server provides three main tools for interacting with the OpenGenes database:\n\n1. **`opengenes_db_query(sql: str)`** - Execute read-only SQL queries against the OpenGenes database\n2. **`opengenes_get_schema_info()`** - Get detailed schema information including tables, columns, and enumerations\n3. **`opengenes_example_queries()`** - Get a list of example SQL queries with descriptions\n\n## Available Resources\n\n1. **`resource://db-prompt`** - Complete database schema documentation and usage guidelines\n2. **`resource://schema-summary`** - Formatted summary of tables and their purposes\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installing uv\n\n```bash\n# Download and install uv\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Verify installation\nuv --version\nuvx --version\n```\n\nuvx is a very nice tool that can run a python package installing it if needed.\n\n### Running with uvx\n\nYou can run the opengenes-mcp server directly using uvx without cloning the repository:\n\n```bash\n# Run the server in streamed http mode (default)\nuvx opengenes-mcp\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other uvx modes (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)</summary>\n\n#### STDIO Mode (for MCP clients that require stdio, can be useful when you want to save files)\n\n```bash\n# Or explicitly specify stdio mode\nuvx opengenes-mcp stdio\n```\n\n#### HTTP Mode (Web Server)\n```bash\n# Run the server in streamable HTTP mode on default (3001) port\nuvx opengenes-mcp server\n\n# Run on a specific port\nuvx opengenes-mcp server --port 8000\n```\n\n#### SSE Mode (Server-Sent Events)\n```bash\n# Run the server in SSE mode\nuvx opengenes-mcp sse\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIn cases when there are problems with uvx often they can be caused by clenaing uv cache:\n```\nuv cache clean\n```\n\nThe HTTP mode will start a web server that you can access at `http://localhost:3001/mcp` (with documentation at `http://localhost:3001/docs`). The STDIO mode is designed for MCP clients that communicate via standard input/output, while SSE mode uses Server-Sent Events for real-time communication.\n\n**Note:** Currently, we do not have a Swagger/OpenAPI interface, so accessing the server directly in your browser will not show much useful information. To explore the available tools and capabilities, you should either use the MCP Inspector (see below) or connect through an MCP client to see the available tools.\n\n## Configuring your AI Client (Anthropic Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n\n### Quick Configuration Example\n\nHere's what you can copy directly into your Claude Desktop or Cursor MCP configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"opengenes-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"opengenes-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MCP_TRANSPORT\": \"stdio\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative: Using Preconfigured Files\n\nWe also provide preconfigured JSON files for different use cases:\n\n- **For STDIO mode (recommended):** Use `mcp-config-stdio.json`\n- **For HTTP mode:** Use `mcp-config.json` \n- **For local development:** Use `mcp-config-stdio-debug.json`\n\n### Configuration Video Tutorial\n\nFor a visual guide on how to configure MCP servers with AI clients, check out our [configuration tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0sHWGJvE0) for our sister MCP server (biothings-mcp). The configuration principles are exactly the same for the OpenGenes MCP server - just use the appropriate JSON configuration files provided above.\n\n### Inspecting OpenGenes MCP server\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using MCP Inspector to explore server capabilities</summary>\n\nIf you want to inspect the methods provided by the MCP server, use npx (you may need to install nodejs and npm):\n\nFor STDIO mode with uvx:\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config-stdio.json --server opengenes-mcp\n```\n\nFor HTTP mode (ensure server is running first):\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config.json --server opengenes-mcp\n```\n\nFor local development:\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config-stdio-debug.json --server opengenes-mcp\n```\n\nYou can also run the inspector manually and configure it through the interface:\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector\n```\n\nAfter that you can explore the tools and resources with MCP Inspector at http://127.0.0.1:6274 (note, if you run inspector several times it can change port)\n\n</details>\n\n### Integration with AI Systems\n\nSimply point your AI client (like Cursor, Windsurf, ClaudeDesktop, VS Code with Copilot, or [others](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients)) to use the appropriate configuration file from the repository.\n\n## Repository setup\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/longevity-genie/opengenes-mcp.git\ncd opengenes-mcp\nuv sync\n```\n\n### Running the MCP Server\n\nIf you already cloned the repo you can run the server with uv:\n\n```bash\n# Start the MCP server locally (HTTP mode)\nuv run server\n\n# Or start in STDIO mode  \nuv run stdio\n\n# Or start in SSE mode\nuv run sse\n```\n\n## Database Schema\n\n<details>\n<summary>Detailed schema information</summary>\n\n### Main Tables\n\n- **lifespan_change** (47 columns): Experimental lifespan data with intervention details across model organisms\n- **gene_criteria** (2 columns): Gene classifications by aging criteria (12 different categories)\n- **gene_hallmarks** (2 columns): Hallmarks of aging mappings for genes\n- **longevity_associations** (11 columns): Population genetics longevity data from human studies\n\n### Key Fields\n\n- **HGNC**: Gene symbol (primary identifier across all tables)\n- **model_organism**: Research organism (mouse, C. elegans, fly, etc.)\n- **effect_on_lifespan**: Direction of lifespan change (increases/decreases/no change)\n- **intervention_method**: Method of genetic intervention (knockout, overexpression, etc.)\n- **criteria**: Aging-related gene classification (12 categories)\n- **hallmarks of aging**: Biological aging processes associated with genes\n\n</details>\n\n## Example Queries\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sample SQL queries for common research questions</summary>\n\n```sql\n-- Get top genes with most lifespan experiments\nSELECT HGNC, COUNT(*) as experiment_count \nFROM lifespan_change \nWHERE HGNC IS NOT NULL \nGROUP BY HGNC \nORDER BY experiment_count DESC \nLIMIT 10;\n\n-- Find genes that increase lifespan in mice\nSELECT DISTINCT HGNC, effect_on_lifespan \nFROM lifespan_change \nWHERE model_organism = 'mouse' \nAND effect_on_lifespan = 'increases lifespan' \nAND HGNC IS NOT NULL;\n\n-- Get hallmarks of aging for genes\nSELECT HGNC, \"hallmarks of aging\" \nFROM gene_hallmarks \nWHERE \"hallmarks of aging\" LIKE '%mitochondrial%';\n\n-- Find longevity associations by ethnicity\nSELECT HGNC, \"polymorphism type\", \"nucleotide substitution\", ethnicity \nFROM longevity_associations \nWHERE ethnicity LIKE '%Italian%';\n\n-- Find genes with both lifespan effects and longevity associations\nSELECT DISTINCT lc.HGNC \nFROM lifespan_change lc \nINNER JOIN longevity_associations la ON lc.HGNC = la.HGNC \nWHERE lc.HGNC IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Safety Features\n\n- **Read-only access**: Only SELECT queries are allowed\n- **Input validation**: Blocks INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE operations\n- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages\n\n## Testing & Verification\n\nThe MCP server is provided with comprehensive tests including LLM-as-a-judge tests that evaluate the quality of responses to complex queries. However, LLM-based tests are disabled by default in CI to save costs.\n\n### Environment Setup for LLM Agent Tests\n\nIf you want to run LLM agent tests that use MCP functions with Gemini models, you need to set up a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:\n\n```bash\n# Create a .env file in the project root\necho \"GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here\" > .env\n```\n\n**Note:** The `.env` file and Gemini API key are only required for running LLM agent tests. All other tests and basic MCP server functionality work without any API keys.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nRun tests for the MCP server:\n```bash\nuv run pytest -vvv -s\n```\n\nYou can also run manual tests:\n```bash\nuv run python test/manual_test_questions.py\n```\n\nYou can use MCP inspector with locally built MCP server same way as with uvx.\n\n*Note: Using the MCP Inspector is optional. Most MCP clients (like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) will automatically display the available tools from this server once configured. However, the Inspector can be useful for detailed testing and exploration.*\n\n*If you choose to use the Inspector via `npx`, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) is recommended for managing Node.js versions.*\n\n## Example questions that MCP helps to answer\n\n<details>\n<summary>Research questions you can explore with this MCP server</summary>\n\n* Interventions on which genes extended mice lifespan most of all?\n* Which knockdowns were most lifespan extending on model animals?\n* What processes are improved in GHR knockout mice?\n* Which genetic intervention led to the greatest increase in lifespan in flies?\n* To what extent did the lifespan increase in mice overexpressing VEGFA?\n* Are there any liver-specific interventions that increase lifespan in mice?\n* Which gene-longevity association is confirmed by the greatest number of studies?\n* What polymorphisms in FOXO3 are associated with human longevity?\n* In which ethnic groups was the association of the APOE gene with longevity shown?\n* Is the INS gene polymorphism associated with longevity?\n* What genes are associated with transcriptional alterations?\n* Which hallmarks are associated with the KL gene?\n* How many genes are associated with longevity in humans?\n* What types of studies have been conducted on the IGF1R gene?\n* What evidence of the link between PTEN and aging do you know? \n* What genes are associated with both longevity and altered expression in aged humans?\n* Is the expression of the ACE2 gene altered with aging in humans?\n* What genes need to be downregulated in worms to extend their lifespan?\n\n</details>\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! 🎉 Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast interested in aging and longevity research, there are many ways to get involved:\n\n**We especially encourage you to try our MCP server and share your feedback with us!** Your experience using the server, any issues you encounter, and suggestions for improvement are incredibly valuable for making this tool better for the entire research community.\n\n### Ways to Contribute\n\n- **🐛 Bug Reports**: Found an issue?
