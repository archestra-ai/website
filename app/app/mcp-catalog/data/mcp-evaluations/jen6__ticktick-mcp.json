Built upon the `ticktick-py` library, it offers significantly improved filtering capabilities, allowing AI assistants and MCP-compatible applications (like Claude Desktop, VS Code Agent Mode, or `mcp-use`) to interact with your tasks with greater precision and power.\n\n\n\n## ✨ Features\n\nThis server provides comprehensive access to TickTick functionalities via MCP tools, categorized as follows:\n\n* **Task Management:** Create, update (including conversion to TickTick's date format), delete, complete, and move tasks.\n* **Subtask Management:** Create subtasks by linking existing tasks.\n* **Task Retrieval:**\n  *  Get all uncompleted tasks.\n  *  Get tasks by ID or specific fields.\n  *  Get completed tasks within a date range.\n  *  Get tasks from a specific project.\n  *  Filter tasks based on various critggeria (priority, project, tags, etc.).\n*  **Project/Tag Management:** Retrieve all projects, tags, and project folders.\n*  **Helper Tools:** Convert datetime strings to the required TickTick format.\n\nRefer to the tool definitions within the `src/ticktick_mcp/tools/` directory for detailed specifications.\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\nThis server utilizes the unofficial [`ticktick-py` library](https://lazeroffmichael.github.io/ticktick-py/) to interact with the TickTick API.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*  Python >= 3.10\n*  Access to TickTick and API credentials (see below).\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Register a TickTick Application:** Before using the server, you need to register an application with TickTick to obtain API credentials. Follow these steps based on the `ticktick-py` documentation:\n    * Go to the [TickTick OpenAPI Documentation](https://developer.ticktick.com/docs#/openapi) and log in with your TickTick account.\n    *  Click on `Manage Apps` in the top right corner.\n    *  Register a new app by clicking the `+App Name` button. Provide a name for your application (e.g., \"MCP Server\").\n    *  Once created, edit the app details. Note down the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.\n    *  For the `OAuth Redirect URL`, enter a URL where you want to be redirected after authorizing the application. It doesn't need to be a live URL\n       *  `http://localhost:8080/redirect` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` are common choices for local development. \n        * **Ensure this exact URL is saved in your environment variables.**\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** The server requires the TickTick API credentials you just obtained, plus your TickTick login details. By default, it looks for a `.env` file located at `~/.config/ticktick-mcp/.env`.\n    * The server *might* create the `~/.config/ticktick-mcp/` directory if it doesn't exist, but it's safer to create it manually.\n    * You **must create the `.env` file manually** within that directory.\n    * Alternatively, you can specify a different directory using the `--dotenv-dir` command-line argument *only* when running the server directly via Python (see \"Running the Server\" below).\n \n    The `.env` file should contain:\n ```dotenv\n TICKTICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id   # Obtained in Step 1\n TICKTICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret # Obtained in Step 1\n TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri # Entered in Step 1 (must match exactly)\n TICKTICK_USERNAME=your_ticktick_email # Your TickTick login email\n TICKTICK_PASSWORD=your_ticktick_password # Your TickTick login password (or app password if enabled)\n ```\n\n3. **Authentication (First Run):** On the first run (either directly or via an MCP client), the underlying `ticktick-py` library will initiate an OAuth2 authentication flow.\n    * A web browser window might open automatically, or a URL will be printed in the console/log output.\n    * You need to visit this URL, log in to TickTick if necessary, and authorize the application (granting Read and Write permissions).\n    * After authorization, you will be redirected to the `TICKTICK_REDIRECT_URI` you specified. \n      * The console will prompt you to **paste this full redirected URL** (which includes a `code=` parameter) back into the terminal.\n    * Upon successful verification, a `.token-oauth` file will be created in the same directory as your `.env` file. \n    * This file caches the authorization token, so you typically only need to perform this manual authorization step once every ~6 months or if the token becomes invalid.\n\n### Running the Server\n\nYou can run the server in two main ways:\n\n**1. Via an MCP Client (Recommended for AI Assistant Integration):**\n\nConfigure your MCP client (like Claude Desktop, VS Code Agent Mode, etc.) to use the server. Example configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n \"mcpServers\": {\n \"ticktick\": {\n  \"command\": \"uvx\",\n  \"args\": [\n  \"--from\",\n  \"git+https://github.com/jen6/ticktick-mcp.git\",\n  \"ticktick-mcp\"\n  // Optional: Add \"--dotenv-dir\", \"/path/to/your/config\" if needed,\n  // but standard clients might not support passing extra args easily.\n  ]\n }\n }\n}\n```\n\n## 🔧 Tools\n\nThis server provides the following tools for interacting with the TickTick task management service:\n\n### Task Management\n\n1. `ticktick_create_task`\n   * Creates a new task in TickTick\n   * Inputs:\n     * `title` (string): The title of the task.

Today's date is {YYYY-MM-DD}. Here's your daily stand-up from TickTick:\n\n **Tasks Due Today:**\n - Task Name 1\n - Task Name 2\n …\n\n **Overdue Tasks:**\n - Task Name 3\n - Task Name 4\n …\n\n4. **Select Key Task** \n > \"Which of these tasks would you like to focus on first or must complete today? \n > Or is there another important task you'd like to add?\"\n\n5. **Task Breakdown (Subtask Creation)** \n - After the user selects a main task, suggest 2–5 specific subtasks needed to complete it. \n - Example (if \"Write project report\" is selected):\n  1. Draft outline & table of contents (10 min) \n  2. Gather & analyze data (30 min) \n  3. Write section drafts (1 h) \n  4. Review & revise draft (30 min) \n  5. Final submission (10 min)\n\n6. **Confirm & Add Subtasks** \n - Ask the user to confirm or adjust the suggested subtasks: \n  > \"Does this breakdown look good? Any changes?\" \n - Once approved, call MCP to add each subtask to TickTick, setting them as children of the main task if supported, naming them \"[Main Task] – [Subtask]\". \n mcp.ticktick.addTask({\n  name: \"[Main Task] – [Subtask]\",\n  parentId: \"...\"\n });\n\n7. **Session Close** \n > \"All subtasks have been added to TickTick. Have a productive day! Anything else I can help with?\"\n\n---\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n- **Tone & Manner**: Friendly, proactive, and organized. \n- **MCP Interface Examples**: \n // Fetch today's due tasks\n mcp.ticktick.getTasks({\n filter_criteria: {\n  status: \"uncompleted\",\n  tz: \"Asia/Seoul\",\n  due_end_date: \"2025-04-29\"\n }\n });\n\n // Add a subtask\n mcp.ticktick.addTask({\n name: \"Project Report – Write Draft\",\n parentId: \"task123\"\n });\n- **Error Handling**: Inform the user and suggest retrying on MCP call failures. \n- **Clarity**: Present task lists and subtask suggestions clearly. \n- **Plan First**: Use `sequential thinking mcp` to plan steps before adding or modifying tasks.\n\n```\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
