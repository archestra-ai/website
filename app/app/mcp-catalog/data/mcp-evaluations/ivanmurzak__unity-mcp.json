This is will be your main chat window to talk with LLM.\n\n- [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)\n- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)\n- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\n- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)\n- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com)\n- Any other supported\n\n> MCP protocol is quite universal, that is why you may any MCP client you prefer, it will work as smooth as anyone else. The only important thing, that the MCP client has to support dynamic tool update.\n\n# 👉 Installation\n\n## Option 1: Install `.unitypackage` installer\n\n-  **[⬇️ Download the Installer ⬇️](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/releases/download/0.16.2/AI-Game-Dev-Installer.unitypackage)**\n- **📂 Open the installer into Unity project 📂**\n  > - You may use double click on the file - Unity will open it\n  > - OR: You may open Unity Editor first, then click on `Assets/Import Package/Custom Package`, then choose the file\n\n## Option 2: Using OpenUPM\n\n> This option is recommended for people well familiar with command line and probably with the NPM package managers.\n\n- [Install OpenUPM-CLI](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation)\n- Open command line in Unity project folder\n- Run the command\n\n```bash\nopenupm add com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp\n```\n\n# 👉 Configure MCP client\n\n## 🟢 Step 1 Open `AI Connector` window\n\nOpen Unity project, go 👉 `Window/AI Connector (Unity-MCP)`.\n\n![Unity_AI](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/blob/main/docs/img/ai-connector-window.gif)\n\n## 🟢 Step 2: Click `Configure` at your MCP client\n\n  > If MCP client is not in the list, use the raw JSON below in the window, to inject it into your MCP client. Read instructions for your MCP client how to do that.\n\n# 👉 Talk to LLM\n\n> Make sure `Agent` mode is turned on in MCP client\n\n  ```text\n  Explain my scene hierarchy\n  ```\n\n  ```text\n  Create 3 cubes in a circle with radius 2\n  ```\n\n  ```text\n  Create metallic golden material and attach it to a sphere gameObject\n  ```\n\n---\n\n# How it works\n\n**[Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP)** is a bridge between LLM and Unity. It exposes and explains to LLM Unity's tools. LLM understands the interface and utilizes the tools in the way a user asks.\n\nConnect **[Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP)** to LLM client such as [Claude](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) using integrated `AI Connector` window. Custom clients are supported as well.\n\nThe project is designed to let developers to add custom tools soon. After that the next goal is to enable the same features in player's build. For not it works only in Unity Editor.\n\nThe system is extensible: you can define custom `tool`s directly in your Unity project codebase, exposing new capabilities to the AI or automation clients. This makes Unity-MCP a flexible foundation for building advanced workflows, rapid prototyping, or integrating AI-driven features into your development process.\n\n---\n\n# Advanced MCP server setup\n\nUnity-MCP server supports many different launch options and docker docker deployment. Both transport protocol are supported `http` and `stdio`. [Read more...](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/blob/main/docs/mcp-server.md)\n\n# Add custom `tool`\n\n> ⚠️ It only works with MCP client that supports dynamic tool list update.\n\nUnity-MCP is designed to support custom `tool` development by project owner. MCP server takes data from Unity plugin and exposes it to a Client. So anyone in the MCP communication chain would receive the information about a new `tool`. Which LLM may decide to call at some point.\n\nTo add a custom `tool` you need:\n\n1. To have a class with attribute `McpPluginToolType`.\n2. To have a method in the class with attribute `McpPluginTool`.\n3. [optional] Add `Description` attribute to each method argument to let LLM to understand it.\n4. [optional] Use `string? optional = null` properties with `?` and default value to mark them as `optional` for LLM.\n\n> Take a look that the line `MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>` it allows to run the code in Main thread which is needed to interact with Unity API. If you don't need it and running the tool in background thread is fine for the tool, don't use Main thread for efficiency purpose.\n\n```csharp\n[McpPluginToolType]\npublic class Tool_GameObject\n{\n    [McpPluginTool\n    (\n        \"MyCustomTask\",\n        Title = \"Create a new GameObject\"\n    )]\n    [Description(\"Explain here to LLM what is this, when it should be called.\")]\n    public string CustomTask\n    (\n        [Description(\"Explain to LLM what is this.\")]\n        string inputData\n    )\n    {\n        // do anything in background thread\n\n        return MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>\n        {\n            // do something in main thread if needed\n\n            return $\"[Success] Operation completed.\";\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# Add custom in-game `tool`\n\n> ⚠️ Not yet supported. The work is in progress\n\n# Running PlayMode tests\n\nTo be able to run Play Mode tests via the TestRunner MCP tool, you should consider configuring Unity to **not** perform a domain reload when entering Play Mode (`Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor -> Enter Play Mode Settings` - set to `Reload Scene only` or `Do not reload Domain or Scene`). Otherwise, starting the Play Mode tests will interrupt the TestRunner MCP tool, leading to a cycle of tests restarting.\n\n---\n\n# Contribution 💙💛\n\nContribution is highly appreciated. Brings your ideas and lets make the game development as simple as never before! Do you have an idea of a new `tool`, feature or did you spot a bug and know how to fix it.\n\n1. 👉 [Fork the project](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/fork)\n2. Clone the fork and open the `./Unity-MCP-Plugin` folder in Unity\n3. Implement new things in the project, commit, push it to GitHub\n4.
