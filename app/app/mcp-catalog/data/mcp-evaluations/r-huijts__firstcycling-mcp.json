Clone this repository\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n   ```\n   uv venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n   # or\n   .venv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   ```\n3. Install dependencies:\n   ```\n   uv pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n## FirstCycling API\n\nThis server uses the [FirstCycling API](https://github.com/baronet2/FirstCyclingAPI), which has been integrated directly into the project. The API provides methods to fetch data from the FirstCycling website through web scraping.\n\n## MCP Tools\n\nThe server exposes the following tools through the Model Context Protocol:\n\n### Rider Information\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `get_rider_info` | Get basic biographical information about a rider including nationality, birthdate, weight, height, and current team |\n| `get_rider_best_results` | Retrieve a rider's best career results, sorted by importance |\n| `get_rider_grand_tour_results` | Get a rider's results in Grand Tours (Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a España) |\n| `get_rider_monument_results` | Retrieve a rider's results in cycling's Monument classics |\n| `get_rider_team_and_ranking` | Get a rider's team history and UCI ranking evolution over time |\n| `get_rider_race_history` | Retrieve a rider's complete race participation history, optionally filtered by year |\n| `get_rider_one_day_races` | Get a rider's results in one-day races, optionally filtered by year |\n| `get_rider_stage_races` | Get a rider's results in multi-day stage races, optionally filtered by year |\n| `get_rider_teams` | Retrieve the complete team history of a rider throughout their career |\n| `get_rider_victories` | Get a list of a rider's career victories, with optional filters for WorldTour or UCI races |\n\n### Race Information\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `get_race_results` | Retrieve results for a specific race edition by race ID and year |\n| `get_race_overview` | Get general information about a race including history, records, and past winners |\n| `get_race_stage_profiles` | Retrieve stage profiles and details for multi-stage races |\n| `get_race_startlist` | Get the startlist for a specific race edition with detailed or basic team information |\n| `get_race_victory_table` | Retrieve the all-time victory table for a race showing riders with most wins |\n| `get_race_year_by_year` | Get year-by-year results for a race with optional classification filter |\n| `get_race_youngest_oldest_winners` | Retrieve information about the youngest and oldest winners of a race |\n| `get_race_stage_victories` | Get information about stage victories in multi-stage races |\n\n### Search Tools\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `search_rider` | Search for riders by name, returning their IDs and basic information |\n| `search_race` | Search for races by name, returning their IDs and basic information |\n\n## Usage\n\n### Development Mode\n\nYou can test the server with MCP Inspector by running:\n\n```\nuv run mcp dev firstcycling.py\n```\n\nThis will start the server and open the MCP Inspector in your browser, allowing you to test the available tools.\n\n### Integration with Claude for Desktop\n\nTo integrate this server with Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. Edit the Claude for Desktop config file, located at:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n2. Add the server to your configuration:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"firstcycling\": {\n         \"command\": \"uv\",\n         \"args\": [\"--directory\", \"/path/to/server/directory\", \"run\", \"firstcycling.py\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Claude for Desktop\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
