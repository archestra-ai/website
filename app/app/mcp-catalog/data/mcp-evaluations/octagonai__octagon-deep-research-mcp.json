Sign up for a free account at [Octagon](https://app.octagonai.co/signup/?redirectToAfterSignup=https://app.octagonai.co/api-keys)\n2. After logging in, from left menu, navigate to **API Keys** \n3. Generate a new API key\n4. Use this API key in your configuration as the `OCTAGON_API_KEY` value\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing or running Octagon Deep Research MCP, you need to have `npx` (which comes with Node.js and npm) installed on your system.\n\n### Mac (macOS)\n\n1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it):\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n2. **Install Node.js (includes npm and npx):**\n   ```bash\n   brew install node\n   ```\n   This will install the latest version of Node.js, npm, and npx.\n\n3. **Verify installation:**\n   ```bash\n   node -v\n   npm -v\n   npx -v\n   ```\n\n### Windows\n\n1. **Download the Node.js installer:**\n   - Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version for Windows.\n2. **Run the installer** and follow the prompts. This will install Node.js, npm, and npx.\n3. **Verify installation:**\n   Open Command Prompt and run:\n   ```cmd\n   node -v\n   npm -v\n   npx -v\n   ```\n\nIf you see version numbers for all three, you are ready to proceed with the installation steps below.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Running on Claude Desktop\n\nTo configure Octagon Deep Research MCP for Claude Desktop:\n\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config\n3. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Replace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key):\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"octagon-deep-research-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"octagon-deep-research-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OCTAGON_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect\n\n### Running on Cursor\n\nConfiguring Cursor Desktop 🖥️\nNote: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+\n\nTo configure Octagon Deep Research MCP in Cursor:\n\n1. Open Cursor Settings\n2. Go to Features > MCP Servers \n3. Click \"+ Add New MCP Server\"\n4. Enter the following:\n   - Name: \"octagon-deep-research-mcp\" (or your preferred name)\n   - Type: \"command\"\n   - Command: `env OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key npx -y octagon-deep-research-mcp`\n\n> If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try `cmd /c \"set OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key && npx -y octagon-deep-research-mcp\"`\n\nReplace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key.\n\nAfter adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools.
