# Finding Bounties

All available bounties are marked with the **ðŸ’Ž Bounty** label in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/archestra-ai/archestra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22ðŸ’Ž+Bounty%22).

# How It Works

1. **Find a bounty**: An Archestra team member announces bounties on GitHub issues
2. **Claim it**: Comment on the issue to express your interest
3. **Get assigned**: Wait for assignment confirmation before starting
4. **Build**: Create your solution and submit a PR
5. **Get paid**: After your PR is merged, we'll sponsor your GitHub account with the bounty amount (processing takes up to 2 weeks)

# Getting Paid

We pay bounties through GitHub Sponsors. **Before starting**, ensure you've activated [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/accounts) for your account - this is required to receive payment.
