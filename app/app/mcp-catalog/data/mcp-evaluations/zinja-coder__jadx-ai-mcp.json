JADX-AI-MCP\n2. [JADX MCP SERVER](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server)\n\n## 🤖 What is JADX-MCP-SERVER?\n\n**JADX MCP Server** is a standalone Python server that interacts with a `JADX-AI-MCP` plugin (see: [jadx-ai-mcp](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp)) via MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets LLMs communicate with the decompiled Android app context live.\n\n---\n\n## Other projects in Zin MCP Suite\n - **[APKTool-MCP-Server](https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server)**\n - **[JADX-MCP-Server](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server)**\n - **[ZIN-MCP-Client](https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client)**\n\n## Current MCP Tools\n\nThe following MCP tools are available:\n\n- `fetch_current_class()` — Get the class name and full source of selected class\n- `get_selected_text()` — Get currently selected text\n- `get_all_classes()` — List all classes in the project\n- `get_class_source()` — Get full source of a given class\n- `get_method_by_name()` — Fetch a method’s source\n- `search_method_by_name()` — Search method across classes\n- `get_methods_of_class()` — List methods in a class\n- `get_fields_of_class()` — List fields in a class\n- `get_smali_of_class()` — Fetch smali of class\n- `get_main_activity_class()` — Fetch main activity from jadx mentioned in AndroidManifest.xml file.\n- `get_main_application_classes_code()` — Fetch all the main application classes' code based on the package name defined in the AndroidManifest.xml.\n- `get_main_application_classes_names()` — Fetch all the main application classes' names based on the package name defined in the AndroidManifest.xml.\n- `get_android_manifest()` — Retrieve and return the AndroidManifest.xml content.\n- `get_strings()` : Fetches the strings.xml file\n- `get_all_resource_file_names()` : Retrieve all resource files names that exists in application\n- `get_resource_file()` : Retrieve resource file content\n- `rename_class()` : Renames the class name\n- `rename_method()` : Renames the method\n- `rename_field()` : Renames the field\n  \n---\n\n## 🗒️ Sample Prompts\n\n🔍 Basic Code Understanding\n\n    \"Explain what this class does in one paragraph.\"\n\n    \"Summarize the responsibilities of this method.\"\n\n    \"Is there any obfuscation in this class?\"\n\n    \"List all Android permissions this class might require.\"\n\n🛡️ Vulnerability Detection\n\n    \"Are there any insecure API usages in this method?\"\n\n    \"Check this class for hardcoded secrets or credentials.\"\n\n    \"Does this method sanitize user input before using it?\"\n\n    \"What security vulnerabilities might be introduced by this code?\"\n\n🛠️ Reverse Engineering Helpers\n\n    \"Deobfuscate and rename the classes and methods to something readable.\"\n\n    \"Can you infer the original purpose of this smali method?\"\n\n    \"What libraries or SDKs does this class appear to be part of?\"\n\n📦 Static Analysis\n\n    \"List all network-related API calls in this class.\"\n\n    \"Identify file I/O operations and their potential risks.\"\n\n    \"Does this method leak device info or PII?\"\n\n🤖 AI Code Modification\n\n    \"Refactor this method to improve readability.\"\n\n    \"Add comments to this code explaining each step.\"\n\n    \"Rewrite this Java method in Python for analysis.\"\n\n📄 Documentation & Metadata\n\n    \"Generate Javadoc-style comments for all methods.\"\n\n    \"What package or app component does this class likely belong to?\"\n\n    \"Can you identify the Android component type (Activity, Service, etc.)?\"\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Getting Started \n\n### 1. Downlaod from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Download both `jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar` and `jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip` files.\n\n\n```bash\n# 0. Download the jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar and jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip\nhttps://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases\n\n# 1. \nunzip jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.zip\n\n├jadx-mcp-server/\n  ├── jadx_mcp.py\n  ├── requirements.txt\n  ├── README.md\n  ├── LICENSE\n\n├jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar\n\n# 2. Install the plugin\n\n# For this you can follow two approaches:\n\n## 1. One liner - execute below command in your shell\njadx plugins --install \"github:zinja-coder:jadx-ai-mcp\"\n\n## The above one line code will install the latest version of the plugin directly into the jadx, no need to download the jadx-ai-mcp's .jar file.\n## 2. Or you can use JADX-GUI to install it by following images as shown below:\n```\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"banner\" height=\"480px\" widht=\"620px\" src=\"docs/assets/img_1231.png\">\n</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"banner\" height=\"480px\" widht=\"620px\" src=\"docs/assets/img_1123.png\">\n</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"banner\" height=\"480px\" widht=\"620px\" src=\"docs/assets/img_2122.png\">\n</div>\n\n\n```bash\n## 3. GUI method, download the .jar file and follow below steps shown in images\n```\n![img.png](docs/assets/img123.png)\n![img_1.png](docs/assets/img_12.png)\n![img_2.png](docs/assets/img_2.png)\n![img_3.png](docs/assets/img_3.png)\n```bash\n# 3. Navigate to jadx-mcp-server directory\ncd jadx-mcp-server\n\n# 4. This project uses uv - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.\n    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet)\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in jadx-mcp-server, Set up the environment\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\n    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies\nuv pip install httpx fastmcp\n\n# The setup for jadx-ai-mcp and jadx_mcp_server is done.\n```\n\n## 2. Running on Local LLM Using Ollama and Zin MCP Client - Recommended\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client\">\n    <img alt=\"zin-mcp-client\" height=\"360px\" widht=\"480px\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8e0ecd-0520-422e-a007-03dc62c4118e\">\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n⚡ Lightweight, Fast, Simple, CLI-Based MCP Client for STDIO MCP Servers, to fill the gap and provide bridge between your local LLMs running Ollama and MCP Servers.\n\nCheck Now: https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client\n\nDemo: **Perform Code Review to Find Vulnerabilities locally**\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cd26715-b5e6-4b4b-95e4-054de6789f42\n\n## 🤖 3. Use Claude Desktop\n\nMake sure Claude Desktop is running with MCP enabled.\n\nFor instance, I have used following for Kali Linux: https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian\n\nConfigure and add MCP server to LLM file:\n```bash\nnano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nFor:\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   \nAnd following content in it:\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"jadx-mcp-server\": {\n            \"command\": \"/<path>/<to>/uv\", \n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"</PATH/TO/>jadx-mcp-server/\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"jadx_mcp_server.py\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace:\n\n- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable\n- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this\nrepository\n\nThen, navigate code and interact via real-time code review prompts using the built-in integration.\n\n## 4. Use Cherry Studio\n\nIf you want to configure the MCP tool in Cherry Studio, you can refer to the following configuration.\n- Type: stdio\n- command: uv\n- argument:\n```bash\n--directory\npath/to/jadx-mcp-server\nrun\njadx_mcp_server.py\n```\n- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this\nrepository\n\n## Give it a shot\n\n1. Run jadx-gui and load any .apk file\n\n![img_1.png](docs/assets/img_1.png)\n\n2. Start claude - You must see hammer symbol\n\n![img2.png](docs/assets/img2.png)\n\n3. Click on the `hammer` symbol and you should you see somthing like following:\n\n![img3.png](docs/assets/img3.png)\n\n4. Run following prompt:\n```text\nfetch currently selected class and perform quick sast on it\n```\n![img4.png](docs/assets/img4.png)\n\n5. Allow access when prompted:\n\n![img_1.png](docs/assets/img5.png)\n\n6. HACK!\n\n![img_2.png](docs/assets/img6.png)\n\nThis plugin allows total control over the GUI and internal project model to support deeper LLM integration, including:\n\n- Exporting selected class to MCP\n- Running automated Claude analysis\n- Receiving back suggestions inline\n\n---\n\n## 🛣️ Future Roadmap\n\n- [x] Add Support for apktool\n\n - [ ] Add support for hermes code (ReactNative Application)\n\n - [ ] Add more useful MCP Tools\n\n - [ ] Make LLM be able to modify code on JADX\n\n - [ ] Add prompts templates, give llm access to Android APK Files as Resources\n\n - [x] Build MCP Client to support Local LLM\n\n - [ ] **END-GOAL** : Make all android reverse engineering and APK modification tools Connect with single MCP server to make reverse engineering apk files as easy as possible purely from vibes.\n\n\n## NOTE For Contributors\n\n - The files related to JADX-AI-MCP can be found under this repo.\n\n - The files related to **jadx-mcp-server** can be found [here](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server).\n\n## To report bugs, issues, feature suggestion, Performance issue, general question, Documentation issue.\n - Kindly open an issue with respective template.\n\n - Tested on Claude Desktop Client, support for other AI will be tested soon!\n\n## 🙏 Credits\n\nThis project is a plugin for JADX, an amazing open-source Android decompiler created and maintained by [@skylot](https://github.com/skylot).
