Please feel free to discuss them by opening an issue.\n\n\n### Install  \n\nFirst, clone this MCP repository:  \n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:horw/esp-mcp.git\n```  \n\nThen, configure it in your chatbot. \n\nThe JSON snippet below is an example of how you might configure this `esp-mcp` server within a chatbot or an agent system that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The exact configuration steps and format may vary depending on the specific chatbot system you are using. Refer to your chatbot's documentation for details on how to integrate MCP servers.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"esp-run\": { // \"esp-run\" is an arbitrary name you can assign to this server configuration.\n            \"command\": \"<path_to_uv_or_python_executable>\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"<path_to_cloned_esp-mcp_repository>\", // e.g., /path/to/your/cloned/esp-mcp\n                \"run\",\n                \"main.py\" // If using python directly, this might be just \"main.py\" and `command` would be your python interpreter\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"IDF_PATH\": \"<path_to_your_esp-idf_directory>\" // e.g., ~/esp/esp-idf or C:\\\\Espressif\\\\frameworks\\\\esp-idf\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA few notes on the configuration:\n\n*   **`command`**: This should be the full path to your `uv` executable if you are using it, or your Python interpreter (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3` or `C:\\\\Python39\\\\python.exe`) if you plan to run `main.py` directly.\n*   **`args`**:\n    *   The first argument to `--directory` should be the absolute path to where you cloned the `esp-mcp` repository.\n    *   If you're using `uv`, the arguments `run main.py` are appropriate. If you're using Python directly, you might only need `main.py` in the `args` list, and ensure your `command` points to the Python executable.\n*   **`IDF_PATH`**: This environment variable must point to the root directory of your ESP-IDF installation. ESP-IDF is Espressif's official IoT Development Framework. If you haven't installed it, please refer to the [official ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) for installation instructions.\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce the `esp-mcp` server is configured and running, your LLM or chatbot can interact with it using the tools defined in this MCP. For example, you could ask your chatbot to:\n\n*   \"Build the project located at `/path/to/my/esp-project` using the `esp-mcp`.\"\n*   \"Clean the build files for the ESP32 project in the `examples/hello_world` directory.\"\n*   \"Flash the firmware to my connected ESP32 device for the project in `my_app`.\"\n\nThe MCP server will then execute the corresponding ESP-IDF commands (like `idf.py build`, `idf.py fullclean`, `idf.py flash`) based on the tools implemented in `main.py`.\n\nThe `result.gif` below shows an example interaction:\n\n![Result](./result.gif)\n\n\n### Examples \n\n\n1.
