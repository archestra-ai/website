It helps LLMs understand Go projects by providing direct access to package documentation without needing to read entire source files. `godoc-mcp` can vastly improve the performance of using LLMs to develop in Go by substantially reducing the number of tokens needed to understand and make use of Go packages.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/mrjoshuak/godoc-mcp@latest\n```\n\n## Why Use godoc-mcp?\n\nIn a sentence: **`godoc-mcp` provides a more token efficient way for LLMs to understand Go projects.**\n\nTraditional file-reading approaches require LLMs to process entire source files often many files to understand a single package. `godoc-mcp` provides several advantages:\n\n1. **Token Efficiency**: Returns only the essential documentation, reducing token usage significantly\n2. **Structured Information**: Provides official package documentation in a consistent, well-structured format\n3. **Project Navigation**: Smart handling of project structures helps LLMs understand multi-package projects\n4. **Integration Ready**: Works alongside other MCP servers, enabling both high-level and detailed code analysis\n5. **Performance**: Caching and optimized token usage make `godoc-mcp` a fast and efficient tool for Go development\n6. **Local**: Does not require an internet connection to access documentation\n\nWith `godoc-mcp`, a LLM can get precisely the information it needs without having to read entire source files. Here are the different levels of detail that an LLM can get.\n\n- Documentation for one exported symbol\n- The complete source for one symbol\n- A list of all exported symbols (the concise documentation)\n- A list of all symbols including unexported symbols\n- The full documentation for a package\n- The entire source for a package\n\nThis makes `godoc-mcp` an essential tool for Go developers using LLMs by enabling LLMs to understand significantly more, and in more detail, about the context than previously possible in any programming language.\n\n## Features\n\nThe server will:\n1. For directories with Go files: Return package documentation\n2. For directories without Go files: List available Go packages in subdirectories\n3. For import paths: Return standard library or third-party package documentation\n\n- **Efficient Documentation Access**: Retrieves official Go documentation with minimal token usage\n- **Smart Package Discovery**: When pointed at a directory without Go files, lists available Go packages in subdirectories\n- **Flexible Path Support**:\n  - Local file paths (e.g., \"/full/path/to/mypackage\")\n  - Import paths (e.g., \"io\", \"github.com/user/repo\")\n- **Automatic Module Context**:\n  - Creates temporary Go projects when needed\n  - Automatically sets up module context for external packages\n  - No manual module setup required for any package documentation\n  - Handles cleanup of temporary projects\n- **Module-Aware**: Supports documentation for third-party packages through working directory context (i.e. it will run `go doc` from the working directory)\n- **Performance Optimized**:\n  - Built-in response caching\n  - Efficient token usage through focused documentation retrieval\n  - Metadata about response sizes\n  - Smart handling of standard library vs external packages\n\n### Examples\n\nIn addition to providing documentation while working on coding tasks. `godoc-mcp` can also be used to explore Go projects and packages. Here are some examples for general prompting:\n\n#### Project Understanding\n\n\"I'm looking at a Go project at /path/to/some/project. What packages does it contain and what do they do?\"\n\n#### Package Interface Understanding\n\n\"What interfaces does the io package provide? I'm particularly interested in anything related to reading.\"\n\n#### Implementation Guidance\n\n\"I need to implement the io.Reader interface. Show me its documentation and any related types I should know about.\"\n\n#### API Usage\n\n\"Show me the documentation for the Resource type in the /path/to/some/project. I need to understand how to create and use it.\"\n\n#### Library Exploration\n\n\"I'm in /path/to/some/project which uses github.com/gorilla/mux. Show me the documentation for the Router type.\"\n\n#### Method Discovery\n\n\"What methods are available on the http.Request type? I'm working with standard library HTTP handlers.\"\n\n#### Focused Learning\n\n\"Explain how to configure the Server type in the /path/to/project/server package.\"\n\n#### Package Browsing\n\n\"I'm in a new Go project directory and see multiple packages. Can you show me what each one does?\"\n\n## Usage\n\nTo add to the Claude desktop app:\n\n```yaml\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    # other MCP servers ...\n    \"godoc\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/godoc-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOPATH\": \"/path/to/go\",\n        \"GOMODCACHE\": \"/path/to/go/pkg/mod\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen connected to an MCP-capable LLM (like Claude), godoc-mcp provides the `get_doc` tool with the following parameters:\n\n- `path`: Path to the Go package or file (import path or file path)\n- `target` (optional): Specific symbol to document (function, type, etc.)\n- `cmd_flags` (optional): Additional go doc command flags\n- `working_dir` (optional): Working directory for module-aware documentation (if not provided, a temporary project will be created automatically)\n\nAdvanced `cmd_flags` values that an LLM can leverage:\n- `-all`: Show all documentation for package, excluding unexported symbols\n- `-u`: Show unexported symbols\n- `-src`: Show the source code instead of documentation\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- For local paths, ensure they contain Go source files or point to directories containing Go packages\n- If you see module-related errors, ensure GOPATH and GOMODCACHE environment variables are set correctly in your MCP server configuration\n- The server automatically handles module context for external packages, but you can still provide a specific working_dir if needed for special cases\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n",
