You can run **your own MCP server** for [over 2,700 apps and APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) and is powered by [Pipedream Connect](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/).\n\n> [Note]\n> These docs discuss how you can host Pipedream's MCP server in your own app or run it locally. To use Pipedream's [remote MCP server](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) (most common), [refer to our docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) to get started.\n\nThis reference implementation shows how you can:\n\n- [Run the servers locally](#running-the-server-via-npx) with `npx @pipedream/mcp`\n- [Host the servers yourself](#hosting-your-own-server) to use them within your app or company\n\nSee the consumer-facing MCP server in action at [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com) and check out a demo of the developer-facing product at [chat.pipedream.com](https://chat.pipedream.com).\n\nWe published this code as a reference, so you can better understand how to use Pipedream Connect for such\nan application. This is a reference implementation specifically for self-hosting the server and may not be fully documented. Please reach out to us if you\nhave any questions.\n\n## ⭐ Features\n\n- Run **your own MCP server** for [over 2,700 apps and APIs](https://mcp.pipedream.com)\n- Manage servers **for your users**, in your own app.\n- Connect accounts, configure params, and make API requests, all via tools\n- Fully-managed OAuth and credential storage ([see security docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/privacy-and-security/#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables))\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\nPipedream's MCP servers use the [Pipedream Connect API](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/) to manage auth and make API requests. To run an MCP server, you'll need a Pipedream project and Pipedream API credentials.\n\n1. [Sign up for Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)\n2. [Create a project](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/projects/#creating-projects). Any accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.\n3. [Create a Pipedream OAuth client](https://pipedream.com/docs/rest-api/auth/#creating-an-oauth-client)\n4. Set the environment variables (See `.env.example`) (directly in your shell session, dot files, etc.):\n\n```bash\nPIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\nPIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\nPIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id\nPIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development\n```\n\n### Pipedream concepts to understand\n\nIf you're running MCP servers for your app, you'll likely want to use the [SSE interface](#sse). The SSE server accepts two route params:\n\n1. `external_user_id` — This is your user’s ID, in your system — whatever you use to uniquely identify them. Any requests made to that route are coupled to that end user, and would use the auth Pipedream stores for that user. [See the docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/api/#external-users) for more detail.\n2. `app` — The app's \"name slug\" (the unique identifier for the app), found in the **Authentication** section of [any Pipedream app](https://pipedream.com/apps). For example, the app slug for [Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) is `slack`.\n\nIf your user `123` wants to connect to the `slack` MCP server, your MCP client would make a request to the `/123/slack` route. [See the SSE docs below](#sse) for more detail.\n\n## Server overview\n\nThere are two ways to use this MCP server.\n\n1 - App specific\n`/{external_user_id}/{app}`\nThis is currently available at [mcp.pipedream.com](mcp.pipedream.com). You can use an endpoint for each app.\nAll the tools available for that app will be available at that endpoint.\n\n2 - Dynamic\n`/{external_user_id}`\nThis is an experimental version, since it relies on tools being able to update dynamically.\nWe use this server to power the tools on [chat.pipedream.com](https://chat.pipedream.com).\n\n> [!NOTE] > [Check out the docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/app-discovery) to learn more about enabling app discovery with the MCP server.\n\n## Hosting your own server\n\n### Using the `Dockerfile`\n\nIf you have Docker installed locally, you can build and run the container:\n\n```console\n> docker build -t pipedream-connect .\n> docker run -d --name pd-mcp -p 3010:3010 --env-file .env pipedream-connect:latest\n```\n\nThis exposes a generic MCP server at [http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app](http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app).\n\n## Development\n\n`cp .env.example .env` and fill in the details of your dev project.\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n### Start the server with Streamable HTTP Transport\n\n```bash\npnpm dev:http\n```\n\nYou can use the optional env var `PD_SDK_DEBUG` to print out all the requests and responses going to the Connect API\n\n```bash\nPD_SDK_DEBUG=true pnpm dev:http\n```\n\nThen run the inspector:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector\n```\n\nUse `http://localhost:3010/v1/{external_user_id}/{app}` for Streamable HTTP Transport or `http://localhost:3010/{external_user_id}/{app}` for SSE Transport.\n\nThese URLs can also be used by other clients (e.g. Cursor).\n\n### Stdio Transport setup\n\nStdio has only been tested with the MCP Inspector.\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector bun src/stdio.ts\n```\n\nSee the logs for the inspector URL.\n\nEnsure the left side of the inspector matches this:\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-12 at 1 05 37 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc650999-353c-45da-add8-7d8de867d6ed)\n\nThen press \"List Tools\" to fetch the list of MCP tools.\n\n## License\n\nPipedream Source Available License Version 1.0 - See https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/LICENSE\n",
