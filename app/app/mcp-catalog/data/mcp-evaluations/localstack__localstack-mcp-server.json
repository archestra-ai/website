The LocalStack MCP Server provides simplified integration between Model Context Protocol-compatible apps and your local AWS development environment, enabling secure and direct communication with LocalStack's assortment of various features.\n\nThis server eliminates custom scripts and manual LocalStack management with direct access to:\n\n- Start, stop, restart, and monitor LocalStack container status with built-in auth.\n- Deploy CDK and Terraform projects with automatic configuration detection.\n- Parse logs, catch errors, and auto-generate IAM policies from violations.\n- Inject chaos faults and network effects into LocalStack to test system resilience.\n- Manage LocalStack state snapshots via Cloud Pods for development workflows.\n- Connect AI assistants and dev tools for automated cloud testing workflows.\n\n## Tools Reference\n\nThis server provides your AI with dedicated tools for managing your LocalStack environment:\n\n| Tool Name                                                                         | Description                                                                | Key Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [`localstack-management`](./src/tools/localstack-management.ts)                   | Manages LocalStack container operations and settings                       | -

This configuration uses `npx` to run the server, which will automatically download & install the package if not already present:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"localstack-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@localstack/localstack-mcp-server\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you installed from source, change `command` and `args` to point to your local build:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"localstack-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/localstack-mcp-server/dist/stdio.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Enabling Licensed Features\n\nTo activate LocalStack licensed features, you need to add your LocalStack Auth Token to the environment variables. You can get your LocalStack Auth Token by following the official [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/getting-started/auth-token/).\n\nHere's how to add your LocalStack Auth Token to the environment variables:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"localstack-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@localstack/localstack-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcomed on GitHub! To get started:\n\n- Install Git and Node.js\n- Clone the repository\n- Install dependencies with `yarn`\n- Build with `yarn build`\n\nBuilt on the [XMCP](https://github.com/basementstudio/xmcp) framework, you can add new tools by adding a new file to the `src/tools` directory and documenting it in the `manifest.json` file.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE)\n",
