Today we are delighted to unveil Archestra and announce that we have raised $3.3m in pre-seed funding from a range of prestigious VCs and angels. Founded with urgency by engineers passionate about the future of AI, Archestra is on track to reshape AI in the enterprise.

**PRESS RELEASE: 14th August 2025, London** - [Archestra](https://www.archestra.ai/), a platform which enables companies to securely use AI agents and connect them to internal data sources safely, has raised $3.3m pre-seed funding in a round led by [Concept Ventures](https://www.conceptventures.vc/).

The over-subscribed raise closed in less than two weeks. Led by [Concept Ventures](https://www.conceptventures.vc/), the round was joined by [Zero Prime Ventures](https://zeroprime.vc/), [Celero Ventures](https://www.celeroventures.com/), [RTP Global](https://rtp.vc/) and [Aloniq](https://www.aloniq.com/). Angels include: [Max Hauser](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hausermax) (Managing Director & Partner BCG), [Maxim Konovalov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim/) (Nginx co-founder), [Konstantin Vinogradov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/kvinogradov) (GP at Runa Capital), [Stephen Whitworth](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/stephenwhitworth) (CEO of incident.io), and [Luke Harries](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/luke-harries) (Elevenlabs).

Archestra is the brain child of serial founders and childhood friends [Matvey Kukuy](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/motakuk) (CEO) and [Ildar Iskhakov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ildari) (CTO). They are joined by Founding Engineer [Joey Orlando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephorlando1/) (ex-Grafana). Matvey and Ildar founded incident response platform [Amixr.IO](https://amixr.io/), which exited to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) in 2021. Matvey went on to co-found AIOps platform [Keep](https://www.keephq.dev/), which exited to [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-keep-join-forces).

The lightning speed at which the team closed the pre-seed round highlights the market opportunity for an enterprise-grade platform which enables non-technical users to leverage AI agents and the MCP without compromising on security. The Archestra solution is part of the burgeoning integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) market that Gartner forecasts will exceed [$17 billion](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6747734) in revenue by 2028.

Enterprises are pushing staff to embrace AI agents and see a major opportunity in using the MCP to connect AI to data; creating more effective human-in-the-loop agentic workflows. However, the MCP - which was [unveiled by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) in November as an open-source framework to help LLMs integrate with external systems and data sources - presents major security and compliance challenges for business.

For example, an AI agent with unfettered access to company data and systems could scrape staff salary data and share it on LinkedIn. Or delete vital information from internal systems.

To avoid these nightmare scenarios, Archestra is building an open-source solution that will act as an “MCP orchestrator”; allowing enterprises to securely embrace MCP and AI agent solutions without compromising on privacy and security. This will operate on multiple levels, enabling orchestration, guardrailing, context management, and dynamic permission management.

> “MCP is unlocking a new frontier for AI agents and initiating a major shift for the whole iPaaS market. But today, it’s completely unsuitable for the enterprise. We’re building the security-first solution that will change this. Our open-source platform means anyone, whether you’re an engineer or a HR rep, can safely and impactfully integrate AI agents into their workflow. The speed at which we’re moving reflects how passionate we are about this solution and the impact we think it can have in the market.”

> “Just as APIs became the foundational building blocks for internet infrastructure, MCPs are emerging as the connective tissue for improving the context layer of AI tools within enterprise. Archestra is building the infrastructure layer this ecosystem needs. At Concept, we leaned into the teams’ technical depth, open-source DNA, and executional intensity to grow into a leader in the category. The team is attacking a mission-critical problem they’ve lived firsthand, and we’re confident they’ll define how enterprises deploy and govern AI context at scale.”
