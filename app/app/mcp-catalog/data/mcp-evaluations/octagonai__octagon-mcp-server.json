This will install Node.js, npm, and npx.\n3. **Verify installation:**\n   Open Command Prompt and run:\n   ```cmd\n   node -v\n   npm -v\n   npx -v\n   ```\n\nIf you see version numbers for all three, you are ready to proceed with the installation steps below.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Running on Claude Desktop\n\nTo configure Octagon MCP for Claude Desktop:\n\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config\n3. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Replace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key):\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"octagon-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"octagon-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OCTAGON_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect\n\n### Running on Cursor\n\nConfiguring Cursor Desktop 🖥️\nNote: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+\n\nTo configure Octagon MCP in Cursor:\n\n1.
