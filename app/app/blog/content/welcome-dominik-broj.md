# AI: The Game Changer with a Catch

I love my life in general, but not every part of it. There are many things I genuinely enjoy and then there are some others that I just have to do - but don’t necessarily enjoy them. Spending time with family and friends, doing sports, building something cool on the web, tinkering with new technologies, teaching people, learning from others, traveling, playing board games… I wish I had more time for those.

To reclaim time from the unwanted but necessary tasks, I automate them. We all do, every day, in one form or another. From automating emails and calendar invites, creating mobile shortcuts, using search engines to quickly find information, to outsourcing accounting, scheduling social media posts or managing subscriptions. Automation is everywhere. Nothing surprising here.

There is something interesting about the time we live in though. The world is moving faster than ever before. AI is a huge boost to automation. And is a true game changer.

As an IT industry, we have an exceptional chance: to give people more time for what they love, what they enjoy, what makes them happy. While it’s tempting to accelerate AI and solve innumerable people’s problems quicker than ever, this opportunity comes with a huge responsibility. If we don’t do it right today, if we don’t embed security at the core, then we could create an ocean of new vulnerabilities. Instead of making the world happier, the result could be quite the opposite.

We’ve come a long way in making the web a relatively safe place. The early days of the Internet though - let’s be honest - were a pure chaos in terms of security. But the lessons we learned along the way give me confidence that we can navigate current transformation more effectively. I want to play my part in that journey.

# Hi, I’m Dominik 👋

New Founding Engineer at Archestra AI, based in Wrocław, Poland.

I bring over 10 years of experience building web applications - experience I’ll leverage to make Archestra great.

My goal is simple: let people automate their day-to-day lives in a secure, reliable and convenient way. I want people to do less while delivering better results - using secure product they trust and enjoy.

That’s my mission at Archestra and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.

When Matvey reached out, I dived into the world of MCP and LLM security. It quickly became clear how impactful Archestra could be and the value it can bring to workplaces.

For me personally it’s also a chance to build a modern, convenient technical foundation that lets us develop a rock-solid, top-quality product - in a way that every team member will appreciate. I believe that’s one of the keys to success.

I’m excited to join Matvey, Ildar and Joey. The sky is not the limit for those guys 😅 Which perfectly aligns with my attitude. I believe Archestra will be a cornerstone of secure AI. And I know that together, we will shape its future.

See you around 🫡
