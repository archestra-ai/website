I have been a long-time fan of Open Source, building and maintaining open source projects like [Grafana OnCall](https://github.com/grafana/oncall), or supporting such a great initiative as [Open Source Endowment](https://endowment.dev/). That's why I believe that planting the right OSS DNA in the company from the first day is crucial.

Today, I'm excited to share that Archestra has officially joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Silver Member and The Linux Foundation. This partnership represents a crucial step forward in our mission to build enterprise-grade infrastructure for AI agents through open collaboration and innovation.

## Our Commitment to Open Source

This membership reinforces our commitment to open-source development. We believe that the future of AI infrastructure should be:

- **Transparent**
- **Interoperable**
- **Community-driven**
- **Enterprise-ready**

## Join Us on This Journey

We're just getting started, and we invite you to be part of this exciting journey. Whether you're a developer interested in contributing code, an enterprise looking to deploy AI agents, or simply curious about the future of AI infrastructure, there's a place for you in our community.
