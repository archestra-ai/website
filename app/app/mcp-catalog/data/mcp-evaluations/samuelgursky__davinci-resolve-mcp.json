This guide covers:\n- Prerequisites and system requirements\n- Step-by-step installation process\n- Configuration details\n- Common troubleshooting steps\n\n## Platform Support\n\n| Platform | Status | One-Step Install | Quick Start |\n|----------|--------|------------------|-------------|\n| macOS | ✅ Stable | `./install.sh` | `./run-now.sh` |\n| Windows | ✅ Stable | `install.bat` | `run-now.bat` |\n| Linux | ❌ Not supported | N/A | N/A |\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n### New One-Step Installation (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to get started is with our new unified installation script. This script does everything automatically:\n\n- Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp.git\n   cd davinci-resolve-mcp\n   ```\n\n- Make sure DaVinci Resolve Studio is installed and running\n\n- Run the installation script:\n   **macOS/Linux:**\n   ```bash\n   ./install.sh\n   ```\n   \n   **Windows:**\n   ```batch\n   install.bat\n   ```\n\nThis will:\n1. Automatically detect the correct paths on your system\n2. Create a Python virtual environment\n3. Install the MCP SDK from the official repository\n4. Set up environment variables\n5. Configure Cursor/Claude integration \n6. Verify the installation is correct\n7. Optionally start the MCP server\n\n### Alternative Quick Start\n\nYou can also use the original quick start scripts:\n\n**Windows Users:**\n```bash\nrun-now.bat\n``` \n\n**macOS Users:**\n```bash\nchmod +x run-now.sh\n./run-now.sh\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor configuration of DaVinci Resolve MCP with different AI assistant clients like Cursor or Claude, see the [config-templates](config-templates) directory.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting guidance, refer to the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#troubleshooting) file which contains solutions to common issues.\n\n### Common Issues\n\n#### Path Resolution\n- The installation scripts now use more robust path resolution, fixing issues with `run-now.sh` looking for files in the wrong locations\n- Always let the scripts determine the correct paths based on their location\n\n#### DaVinci Resolve Detection\n- We've improved the process detection to reliably find DaVinci Resolve regardless of how it appears in the process list\n- Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting the MCP server\n\n#### Environment Variables\n- Make sure all required environment variables are set correctly\n- Review the log file at `scripts/cursor_resolve_server.log` for troubleshooting\n\n### Windows\n- Make sure to use forward slashes (/) in configuration files\n- Python must be installed and paths configured in configs\n- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server\n\n### macOS\n- Make sure scripts have execute permissions\n- Check Console.app for any Python-related errors\n- Verify environment variables are set correctly\n- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues and feature requests, please use the GitHub issue tracker.\n\n## Launch Options\n\nAfter installation, you have several ways to start the server:\n\n### Client-Specific Launch Scripts\n\nThe repository includes dedicated scripts for launching with specific clients:\n\n```bash\n# For Cursor integration (macOS)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n\n# For Claude Desktop integration (macOS)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n```\n\nThese specialized scripts:\n- Set up the proper environment for each client\n- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running\n- Configure client-specific settings\n- Start the MCP server with appropriate parameters\n\n### Pre-Launch Check\n\nBefore connecting AI assistants, verify your environment is properly configured:\n\n```bash\n# On macOS\n./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh\n\n# On Windows\n./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat\n```\n\nThese scripts will:\n- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running (and offer to start it)\n- Check environment variables are properly set\n- Ensure the Python environment is configured correctly\n- Validate Cursor/Claude configuration\n- Optionally launch Cursor\n\n### Universal Launcher\n\nFor advanced users, our unified launcher provides full control over both Cursor and Claude Desktop servers:\n\n```bash\n# Make the script executable (macOS only)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh\n\n# Run in interactive mode\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh\n\n# Or use command line options\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor    # Start Cursor server (uses mcp_resolve-cursor_start)\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude    # Start Claude Desktop server (uses mcp_resolve-claude_start)\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-both      # Start both servers\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --stop-all        # Stop all running servers\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --status          # Show server status\n```\n\nAdditional options:\n- Force mode (skip Resolve running check): `--force`\n- Project selection: `--project \"Project Name\"`\n\n## Full Installation\n\nFor a complete manual installation:\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp.git\n   cd davinci-resolve-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. Create a Python virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   # Create virtual environment\n   python -m venv venv\n   \n   # Activate it\n   # On macOS/Linux:\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   # On Windows:\n   venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   \n   # Install dependencies from requirements.txt\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   \n   # Alternatively, install MCP SDK directly\n   pip install git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git\n   ```\n\n3. Set up DaVinci Resolve scripting environment variables:\n\n   **For macOS**:\n   ```bash\n   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API=\"/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Scripting\"\n   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB=\"/Applications/DaVinci Resolve/DaVinci Resolve.app/Contents/Libraries/Fusion/fusionscript.so\"\n   export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:$RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules/\"\n   ```\n\n   **For Windows**:\n   ```cmd\n   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API=C:\\ProgramData\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\Support\\Developer\\Scripting\n   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB=C:\\Program Files\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\fusionscript.dll\n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API%\\Modules\n   ```\n   \n   Alternatively, run the pre-launch check script which will set these for you:\n   ```\n   # On macOS\n   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh\n   \n   # On Windows\n   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat\n   ```\n\n4. Configure Cursor to use the server by creating a configuration file:\n\n   **For macOS** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"/path/to/your/venv/bin/python\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **For Windows** (`%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\mcp.json`):\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\venv\\\\Scripts\\\\python.exe\",\n         \"args\": [\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\davinci-resolve-mcp\\\\src\\\\main.py\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Start the server using one of the client-specific scripts:\n   ```bash\n   # For Cursor\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n   \n   # For Claude Desktop\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n   ```\n\n## Usage with AI Assistants\n\n### Using with Cursor\n\n1. Start the Cursor server using the dedicated script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n   ```\n   Or use the universal launcher:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor\n   ```\n\n2. Start Cursor and open a project.\n\n3. In Cursor's AI chat, you can now interact with DaVinci Resolve. Try commands like:\n   - \"What version of DaVinci Resolve is running?\"\n   - \"List all projects in DaVinci Resolve\"\n   - \"Create a new timeline called 'My Sequence'\"\n   - \"Add a marker at the current position\"\n\n### Using with Claude Desktop\n\n1. Create a `claude_desktop_config.json` file in your Claude Desktop configuration directory using the template in the `config-templates` directory.\n\n2. Run the Claude Desktop server using the dedicated script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n   ```\n   Or use the universal launcher:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude\n   ```\n\n3. In Claude Desktop, you can now interact with DaVinci Resolve using the same commands as with Cursor.\n\n## Available Features\n\n### General\n- Get DaVinci Resolve version\n- Get/switch current page (Edit, Color, Fusion, etc.)\n\n### Project Management\n- List available projects\n- Get current project name\n- Open project by name\n- Create new project\n- Save current project\n\n### Timeline Operations\n- List all timelines\n- Get current timeline info\n- Create new timeline\n- Switch to timeline by name\n- Add marker to timeline\n\n### Media Pool Operations\n- List media pool clips\n- Import media file\n- Create media bin\n- Add clip to timeline\n\n## Windows Support Notes\n\nWindows support is stable in v1.3.3 and should not require additional troubleshooting:\n- Ensure DaVinci Resolve is installed in the default location\n- Environment variables are properly set as described above\n- Windows paths may require adjustment based on your installation\n- For issues, please check the logs in the `logs/` directory\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### DaVinci Resolve Connection\nMake sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting the server.

The code is structured with clear sections for different areas of functionality.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- Blackmagic Design for DaVinci Resolve and its API\n- The MCP protocol team for enabling AI assistant integration\n\n## Project Structure\n\nAfter cleanup, the project has the following structure:\n\n- `resolve_mcp_server.py` - The main MCP server implementation\n- `run-now.sh` - Quick start script that handles setup and runs the server\n- `setup.sh` - Complete setup script for installation\n- `check-resolve-ready.sh` - Pre-launch check to verify DaVinci Resolve is ready\n- `start-server.sh` - Script to start the server\n- `run-server.sh` - Simplified script to run the server directly\n\n**Key Directories:**\n- `src/` - Source code and modules\n- `assets/` - Project assets and resources\n- `logs/` - Log files directory\n- `scripts/` - Helper scripts\n\nWhen developing, it's recommended to use `./run-now.sh` which sets up the environment and launches the server in one step. \n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes. \n\n### Cursor-Specific Setup\n\nWhen integrating with Cursor, follow these specific steps:\n\n1. Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n\n2. Install required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   # From the davinci-resolve-mcp directory:\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   Note: This will install the MCP package and other dependencies automatically.\n\n3. Set up the MCP server configuration in Cursor:\n   \n   Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` on macOS (or `%USERPROFILE%\\.cursor\\mcp.json` on Windows):\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"/path/to/your/venv/bin/python\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   **Important Notes:**\n   - Use `main.py` as the entry point (not `resolve_mcp_server.py`)\n   - Use absolute paths in the configuration\n\n4. Common issues:\n   - \"Client closed\" error: Check that paths are correct in mcp.json and dependencies are installed\n   - Connection problems: Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n   - Environment variables: The main.py script will handle setting environment variables",
