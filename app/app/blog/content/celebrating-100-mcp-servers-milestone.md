Today we noticed that 100 MCP servers now have an "Archestra Trust Score" badge in their GitHub repos!

We quite frankly didn't expect the idea of "one more catalog" to receive such an appreciation, but seems like our simple idea of open source catalog + open source quality is what the ecosystem is missing.

This is just a small note of appreciation from me personally and the whole Archestra team to each one of those 100 MCP server builders who supported our open source MCP catalog. You added the Archestra catalog badge to your repos - thank you!

The full list is here ðŸŽ‰:
