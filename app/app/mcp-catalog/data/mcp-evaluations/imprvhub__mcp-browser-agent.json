When you run `npm install`, the required Playwright dependencies will be installed. The package supports the following browsers:\n\n- Chrome (default)\n- Firefox\n- Microsoft Edge\n- WebKit (Safari engine)\n\nWhen you first use a browser type, Playwright will automatically install the corresponding browser drivers as needed. You can also install them manually with the following commands:\n\n```\nnpx playwright install chrome\nnpx playwright install firefox\nnpx playwright install webkit\nnpx playwright install msedge\n```\n\n> **Note about Safari**: Playwright doesn't provide direct support for Safari browser. Instead, it uses WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari.\n>\n> **Note about Edge**: When selecting Edge as the browser type, the agent will actually launch Microsoft Edge (not Chromium). Technically, in Playwright, Edge is launched using the Chromium browser instance with the 'msedge' channel parameter because Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium.\n## Installation\n\n### Installing Manually\n1. Clone or download this repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-browser-agent\ncd mcp-browser-agent\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Build the project:\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Running the MCP Server\n\nThere are two ways to run the MCP server:\n\n### Option 1: Running manually\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the server directly:\n\n```\nnode dist/index.js\n```\n\nKeep this terminal window open while using Claude Desktop. The server will run until you close the terminal.\n\n### Option 2: Auto-starting with Claude Desktop (recommended for regular use)\n\nThe Claude Desktop can automatically start the MCP server when needed. To set this up:\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:\n\n- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nEdit this file to add the Browser Agent MCP configuration. If the file doesn't exist, create it:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserAgent\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js\",\n      \"--browser\",\n      \"chrome\"\n    ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY` with the **complete absolute path** where you installed the MCP\n  - macOS/Linux example: `/Users/username/mcp-browser-agent`\n  - Windows example: `C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\mcp-browser-agent`\n\nIf you already have other MCPs configured, simply add the \"browserAgent\" section inside the \"mcpServers\" object. Here's an example of a configuration with multiple MCPs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"otherMcp1\": {\n      \"command\": \"...\",\n      \"args\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    \"otherMcp2\": {\n      \"command\": \"...\",\n      \"args\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    \"browserAgent\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js\",\n      \"--browser\",\n      \"chrome\"\n    ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Browser Selection\n\nThe MCP Browser Agent supports multiple browser types. By default, it uses Chrome, but you can specify a different browser in several ways:\n\n### Option 1: Configuration File\n\nCreate or edit the file `.mcp_browser_agent_config.json` in your home directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"browserType\": \"chrome\"\n}\n```\n\nSupported values for `browserType` are:\n- `chrome` - Uses installed Chrome (default)\n- `firefox` - Uses Firefox 'Nightly' browser\n- `webkit` - Uses WebKit engine (Note: This is not Safari itself but the WebKit rendering engine that powers Safari)\n- `edge` - Uses Microsoft Edge\n\n> **Note about Safari**: Playwright doesn't provide direct support for Safari browser. Instead, it uses WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari. The WebKit implementation in Playwright provides similar functionality but is not identical to the Safari browser experience.\n\n### Option 2: Command Line Argument\n\nWhen starting the MCP server manually, you can specify the browser type:\n\n```\nnode dist/index.js --browser firefox\n```\n\n### Option 3: Environment Variable\n\nSet the `MCP_BROWSER_TYPE` environment variable:\n\n```\nMCP_BROWSER_TYPE=firefox node dist/index.js\n```\n\n### Option 4: Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nWhen configuring the MCP in Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`, you can specify the browser type:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserAgent\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js\",\n        \"--browser\",\n        \"chrome\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nMCP Browser Agent is built on the Model Context Protocol, enabling Claude to interact with a headful browser through Playwright. The implementation consists of four main components:\n\n1. **Server (index.ts)**\n   - Initializes the MCP server with Model Context Protocol standard protocol\n   - Configures server capabilities for tools and resources\n   - Establishes communication with Claude through the stdio transport\n\n2. **Tools Registry (tools.ts)**\n   - Defines browser and API tool schemas\n   - Specifies parameters, validation rules, and descriptions\n   - Registers tools with the MCP server for Claude's discovery\n\n3. **Request Handlers (handlers.ts)**\n   - Manages MCP protocol requests for tools and resources\n   - Exposes browser logs and screenshots as queryable resources\n   - Routes tool execution requests to the appropriate handlers\n\n4. **Executor (executor.ts)**\n   - Manages browser and API client lifecycle\n   - Implements browser automation functions using Playwright\n   - Handles API requests with proper error handling and response parsing\n   - Maintains stateful browser session between commands\n\n### Agent Capabilities\n\nUnlike basic integrations, MCP Browser Agent functions as a true AI agent by:\n\n- Maintaining persistent browser state across multiple commands\n- Capturing detailed console logs for debugging\n- Storing screenshots for reference and review\n- Managing complex interaction sequences\n- Providing detailed error information for recovery\n- Supporting chained operations for complex workflows\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### Browser Tools\n\n| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to a URL | `url` (required), `timeout`, `waitUntil` |\n| `browser_screenshot` | Capture screenshot | `name` (required), `selector`, `fullPage`, `mask`, `savePath` |\n| `browser_click` | Click element | `selector` (required) |\n| `browser_fill` | Fill form input | `selector` (required), `value` (required) |\n| `browser_select` | Select dropdown option | `selector` (required), `value` (required) |\n| `browser_hover` | Hover over element | `selector` (required) |\n| `browser_evaluate` | Execute JavaScript | `script` (required) |\n\n### API Tools\n\n| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| `api_get` | GET request | `url` (required), `headers` |\n| `api_post` | POST request | `url` (required), `data` (required), `headers` |\n| `api_put` | PUT request | `url` (required), `data` (required), `headers` |\n| `api_patch` | PATCH request | `url` (required), `data` (required), `headers` |\n| `api_delete` | DELETE request | `url` (required), `headers` |\n\n## Resource Access\n\nThe MCP Browser Agent exposes the following resources:\n\n- `browser://logs` - Access browser console logs\n- `screenshot://[name]` - Access screenshots by name\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere are some realistic examples of how to use the MCP Browser Agent with Claude:\n\n### Basic Browser Navigation\n\n```\nNavigate to the Google homepage at https://www.google.com\n```\n\n```\nTake a screenshot of the current page and name it \"google-homepage\"\n```\n\n```\nType \"weather forecast\" in the search box\n```\n\n### Simple Interactions\n\n```\nNavigate to https://www.wikipedia.org and search for \"Model Context Protocol\"\n```\n\n```\nGo to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown and select the option \"Option 1\" from the dropdown\n```\n\n### Basic Form Filling\n\n```\nNavigate to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login and fill in the username field with \"tomsmith\" and the password field with \"SuperSecretPassword!\"\n```\n\n```\nGo to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login, fill in the username and password fields, then click the login button\n```\n\n### Simple JavaScript Execution\n\n```\nGo to https://example.com and execute a JavaScript script to return the page title\n```\n\n```\nNavigate to https://www.google.com and execute a JavaScript script to count the number of links on the page\n```\n\n### Basic API Requests\n\n```\nPerform a GET request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\n```\n\n```\nMake a POST request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts with appropriate JSON data\n```\n\nThese examples represent the actual capabilities of the MCP Browser Agent and are more realistic about what it can accomplish in its current state.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Server disconnected\" error\nIf you see the error \"MCP Browser Agent: Server disconnected\" in Claude Desktop:\n\n1. **Verify the server is running**:\n   - Open a terminal and manually run `node dist/index.js` from the project directory\n   - If the server starts successfully, use Claude while keeping this terminal open\n\n2. **Check your configuration**:\n   - Ensure the absolute path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct for your system\n   - Double-check that you've used double backslashes (`\\\\`) for Windows paths\n   - Verify you're using the complete path from the root of your filesystem\n\n### Browser not appearing\nIf the browser doesn't launch or you don't see it:\n\n1. **Check if the specified browser is installed**\n   - Verify that you have the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari/WebKit) installed on your system\n   - The browser drivers are handled automatically by Playwright\n\n2. **Restart the server and Claude Desktop**\n   - Kill any existing node processes that might be running the server\n   - Restart Claude Desktop to establish a fresh connection\n\n### Browser process not closing properly\nThere are known issues with Chromium and Chrome browsers where the process sometimes doesn't terminate properly after use. If you experience this issue:\n\n1. **Manually close the browser process**:\n   - **Windows**: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager, find the Chrome/Chromium process and end it\n   - **macOS**: Open Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor), find the Chrome/Chromium process and click the X to terminate it\n   - **Linux**: Run `ps aux | grep chrome` or `ps aux | grep chromium` to find the process, then `kill <PID>` to terminate it\n\n2. **Note about browser compatibility**:\n   - This issue has been observed primarily with Chromium and Chrome\n   - Firefox and Playwright's built-in browser don't typically experience this problem\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This MCP integration is built on Playwright, which has known issues and bugs that may affect its operation. Please report any issues you encounter with the browser automation to [Playwright's GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues). The Playwright team is continuously working to address these issues, but this agent provides a foundation for browser automation capabilities with Claude Desktop despite these limitations.\n\n## Development\n\n### Project Structure\n\n- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point and MCP server initialization\n- `src/tools.ts`: Tool schemas and registration\n- `src/handlers.ts`: MCP request handlers for tools and resources\n- `src/executor.ts`: Tool implementation logic using Playwright\n\n### Building\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Watching for Changes\n\n```\nnpm run watch\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nThe project includes tests to verify core functionality and browser handling.\n\n```\nnpm test               # Run tests\nnpm run test:watch     # Watch mode\nnpm run test:coverage  # Coverage report\n```\n\nTests verify configuration integrity, browser automation features, error handling, and process cleanup. The test suite focuses particularly on ensuring proper handling of browser processes due to known issues with Chrome/Chromium termination.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> This MCP integration provides Claude with autonomous browser control capabilities.
